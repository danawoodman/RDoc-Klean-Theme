# RDoc Klean Theme

## Description

A pretty RDoc theme.

I got fed up with how ugly RDoc generated documentation is by default so I spend a little bit making a theme I enjoy.

Just replace the `rdoc-theme.css` file in your RDoc generated documentation with the `rdoc-theme.css` file in this package and reload the page and you should see an improved documentation page.

Enjoy!
